Front identification at the surface is important for defining WRs and
FRs. Generally, front identification is based on the gradient of ground or
low-level meteorological elements. The inclining feature of fronts together with the hilly terrain in South China make objective front
identification quite difficult. Therefore, in this paper, the locations of
fronts are analyzed by forecasters who subjectively locate fronts using a
combination of temperature and wind observations in the surface and
925-hPa layers. Specifically, if a front is strong (clear) enough in the
surface analyses, we locate the fronts based on the hourly surface observations (mainly by significant temperature gradients). Otherwise, we
determine the fronts mainly based on the 925-hPa directional wind
shear (significant difference in wind direction) and temperature gradients\cite{WU2020104693}

The solid brown lines and dotted blue lines in (a, b) identify the positions of the shear lines and 113°E, respectively. The solid squares and triangles in (c, d) are the latitudinal position of the precipitation areas and the fronts, respectively.}
